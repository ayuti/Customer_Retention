# Employee_Retention
The HR department at Salifort Motors, a large ficticious consulting firm, has asked us to conduct an in-depth analysis of employee retention and to develop a predictive model that can help us predict whether employees will be retained or depart. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company and building a robust model would help in identifying factors that would improve retention.
